Deployed Application: https://leah-choco.github.io/Code-Quiz/

## Goals of this Assignment

I was asked to write HTML, CSS, and Javascript for a quiz application. 

## What I Learned

This project required that I use a timer and store scores to localStorage. I wasn't able to successfully complete that part of the project. 

I did learn about "hide" which enabled me to change questions and which buttons appeared. 

I am by no means done with this, but have been experiencing a family emergency and ran into the deadline to turn this in.
